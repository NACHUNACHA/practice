        <h2>What is <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span></h2>
        <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections. These can range from the common cold to more serious diseases.</p> 
        <p><span class="covid19">COVID-19</span> is a disease caused by a new form of coronavirus. It was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City in China.</p>
        <p>Other coronaviruses include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="symptoms" id="symptoms">
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Symptoms of <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span> can range from mild illness to pneumonia. Some people will recover easily, and others may get very sick very quickly. People with coronavirus may experience symptoms such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>fever</li>
            <li>respiratory symptoms</li>
            <ul>
                <li>coughing</li>
                <li>sore throat</li>
                <li>shortness of breath</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Other symptoms can include runny nose, headache, muscle or joint pains, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of sense of smell, altered sense of taste, loss of appetite and fatigue.</p>
        <p>To stop the spread of <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span> people with even mild symptoms of respiratory infection should get tested.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Respiratory allergies – allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and allergic asthma</strong></p>
        <p>People who have hay fever or allergic asthma may have similar symptoms to the symptoms of <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span>. Some differences are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>fever does not occur with hay fever or allergic asthma</li>
            <li>itchy nose, itchy and watery eyes, and itchy throat and palate are common symptoms of hay fever but not <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It can be difficult to tell if your symptoms are due to allergies or to <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span>. You should stay home and get tested:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>when you first get the allergy symptoms, and</li>
            <li>if your symptoms are unexpected, seem different or worse than usual, or do not respond to your usual medication.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="spreads" id="spreads">
        <h2>How it spreads</h2>
        <p>The virus can spread from person to person through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>close contact with an infectious person (including in the 48 hours before they had <a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/coronavirus-covid-19-symptoms-and-how-the-virus-spreads-faqs">symptoms</a>)</li>
            <li>contact with droplets from an infected person’s cough or sneeze</li>
            <li>touching objects or surfaces (like doorknobs or tables) that have droplets from an infected person, and then touching your mouth or face.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="covid19">COVID-19</span> is a new disease, so there is no existing immunity in our community. This means that <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span> could spread widely and quickly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risks" id="risks">
        <h2>Who is most at risk</h2>
        <p>In Australia, the people most at risk of catching the virus are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>travellers who have recently been overseas</li>
            <li>those who have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span></li>
            <li>people in correctional and detention facilities</li>
            <li>people in group residential settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are at high risk of serious illness from <span class="covid19">COVID-19</span> if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>are age 70 years and older</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/advice-for-people-at-risk-of-coronavirus-covid-19">have certain conditions which compromise their immune systems</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are at moderate risk of serious illness from COVID-19 if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/advice-for-people-at-risk-of-coronavirus-covid-19">have certain chronic conditions</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have any medical conditions it is recommended you discuss your individual risk and what you can do to protect yourself with your treating doctor.</p>
        <p>At this stage the risk to children and babies, and the role children play in the transmission of COVID-19, is not clear. However, there has so far been a low rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases among children, relative to the broader population. For more information about COVID-19 and children please read this <a href="#">fact sheet</a>.</p>
        <p>There is limited evidence at this time regarding the risk in pregnant women.</p>
